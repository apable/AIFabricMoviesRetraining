"STORY: Sparks fly when a young, not-so-rich boy, Aditya (Jayaram Karthik), meets a wealthy girl Pushpa,(Arjumman Mughal), and they fall in love almost instantaneously. The duo gets married soon after, but is this true love or is the chap in it for her money?
REVIEW: Theirs was a whirlwind romance and the much-in-love couple takes the relationship ahead and gets married in no time. All Pushpa wanted was unconditional love and to spend some quality time with her husband, but Aditya is busy managing his business and the extra marital affair with his secretary Tina (Anusmriti Sarkar). To have both money and love in his life, Aditya plans Pushpa’s murder with the help of Shyam (Krishna Abhishek), but soon he realises that Shyam has duped him and is now persuading his wife Pushpa. Amidst all that chaos and commotion, will Aditya finally succeed in executing his plans or will this result in him losing everything in life.
Director Dinkar Kapoor has put in a lot of efforts to make this film a feel-good romcom, but the story's predictability makes it yet another run-of-the-mill take on romance, revenge, betrayal and sex. Also, the lengthy plotline leaves the director with no choice but to repeat some of the scenes and sequences, making it a tedious watch.
Debutant Jayaram Karthik has to brush up on his acting skills as his expressions remain somewhat constant throughout the movie. On the other hand, Arjumman Mughal and Anusmriti Sarkar render the right amount of cinematic support to the actor with some decent performances. Krishna Abhishek has acted well, too, but his punch lines seem to be the recurring theme in this film; no reason to laugh beyond a point. Also, the humour aspect of it looks forced upon, because at times there's no room for fun and goof but the writer incorporates it anyway. As for the music, it is easily forgettable except for the title track -- ‘Pushpa, I hate tears’ -- which is decently peppy.
Needless to say, O Pushpa I Hate Tears will remind one of yesteryear actor Rajesh Khanna’s famous dialogue which the movie's title is inspired from. But, sans that, there isn't much for the viewers... This Pushpa is passable!",positive
