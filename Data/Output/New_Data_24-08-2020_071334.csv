"STORY: Based on the life of businessman Rizwan Adatia, this film traces his journey from Gujarat to Africa while highlighting his values and victories.
REVIEW: Resembling a slow-paced documentary, Haresh Vyas’ ‘Rizwan’ introduces a myriad of characters who were instrumental in the success of the protagonist. From Gujarat’s Porbandar to DR Congo’s Kinshasa, the young Rizwan (Vikram Mehta) paves his way to become one of the biggest businessmen in Africa.
It’s supposed to be a story of resilience in the face of adversity, for Rizwan deals with gruesome riots, betrayal and loss, all with a positive attitude. However, the only aspect that’s inspiring is the film’s background score, which helps you drag through the mundane script. The narrative is filled with irrelevant dates and names of characters, making it cumbersome to follow through. You eventually lose track of the many businesses he was a part of. Nonetheless, Vikram Mehta’s performance is quite tolerable, unlike the rest of the characters who are off-scale in most of the scenes. Towards the end, the monologue by the real Rizwan Adatia, narrating this business ventures and values, subtly conveys the motive of this film.
So, if you’re simply looking for some inspiration then you could afford to give this one a miss.",positive
